# Smart-baby-cradle-Ai
This project aims to build an intelligent, automated baby cradle using a Raspberry Pi, integrating features like automatic rocking, cry detection, environmental monitoring, and remote access. The smart cradle provides real-time monitoring, and reduces the need for constant manual intervention by parents.
